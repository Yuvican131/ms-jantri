/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes security by enforcing a strict owner-only access model for most data.
 * It leverages denormalization to avoid costly `get()` calls and maintains clear, auditable logic.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /clients/{clientId}: Stores client information. Access is unrestricted in this prototype to quickly unlock the app for client management.
 * - /sheetLogs/{logId}: Stores logs of saved sheets. Read/write access is unrestricted in this prototype.
 * - /declaredNumbers/{drawName}: Stores declared numbers for draws. Read/write access is unrestricted in this prototype.
 * - /accounts/{accountId}: Stores account data for auditing. Read/write access is unrestricted in this prototype.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Unrestricted access: For prototyping purposes, `clients`, `sheetLogs`, `declaredNumbers`, and `accounts` collections are unrestricted.
 * - In future iterations, the rules will be tightened to owner-only or role-based access as needed.
