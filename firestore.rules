/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where each user has complete control over their own data. All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring that only the authenticated user can access their respective data. Authorization independence is achieved via denormalization.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}: Stores client data, owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/accounts/{accountId}: Stores account data, owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/sheets/{sheetId}: Stores sheet data, also owned by the user, with denormalized clientId and accountId for efficient authorization.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to prevent unauthorized data access.
 * - All write operations are strictly validated against the authenticated user's ID.
 * - Authorization independence is achieved by denormalizing the `clientId` and `accountId` into the `sheets` documents.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Sheet` entity includes `clientId` and `accountId` fields. This avoids the need for expensive `get()` calls to the `clients` and `accounts` collections during authorization, leading to more efficient and scalable rules.
