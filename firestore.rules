/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the GridSheet Manager application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for Clients and Sheets,
 * ensuring that only authenticated users can manage their own data. Accounts
 * are managed as global data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /clients/{clientId}: Stores client data, owned by a specific user.
 * - /clients/{clientId}/sheets/{sheetId}: Stores sheet data, owned by a specific client.
 * - /accounts/{accountId}: Stores account data, globally accessible.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All write operations on Clients and Sheets require the user to be the owner,
 *   as determined by the document path.
 * - Data validation is limited to relational integrity (e.g., clientId consistency).
 * - List operations are restricted to owners for client and sheet subcollections.
 * - Account data is globally accessible for read operations but write operations are disallowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Sheet documents contain a `clientId` field, which is used to ensure that
 *   the sheet belongs to the correct client. This avoids needing to perform
 *   a `get()` operation on the parent client document to verify ownership.
